History:
--------


Version 1.0 :  1998-02-17
    First release (Roche)


Version 1.1 :  1998-02-18
    Reading/writing  to  stdin/stdout  under  MS-DOS didn't work correctly.
    Fixed. (Roche)


Version 1.2 :  1998-03-01
    Corrected  a  small  and  harmless  bug.  When using the z command, the
temporary  file  name was saved in the gzip compressed file.  So if someone
tried to unpack it with gzip with the -N option, gzip would generate a file
with a very strange name.  Fixed. (Roche)


Version 1.3 : 1999-03-24
    Fixed  a  major bug in the decompression functions that caused complete
failure with some DMS files, mostly generated by old versions of DMS.  Made
some  other minor changes.  Changed the Makefile to strip debug information
from the executable. (Roche)


Version 1.3.1 : 2004-09-02
    Moved to C99 type definitions (#include <stdint.h>). Replaced tmpnam()
    with mkstemp(). Fixed print formatters. Fixed ambiguous C language
    constructs. Added a simple configure script for consistent compilation
    and installation.

No Version : 2004-09-10
    Fixed file permissions for documentation directory.
    (Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>)

Version 1.3.2 : 2006-06-25
    Added -f option to override errors in unpacked data. It can be useful for
    desperate data salvation. Please send me corrupted dms images for
    further analysis to improve xdms.
    (Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>)

No version : 2006-06-25
    Added a broken support for operating systems without mkstemp() (bad, bad!).
    To compile on such a system, read README.md. After ./configure you must
    edit src/xdmsconfig.h and then you can issue 'make'.
    (Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>)

No version : 2006-08-16
    Automatic detection for MINGW to avoid mkstemp(). Use mkstemps() instead.
    (Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>)

No version : 2006-08-17
    Cleaned up configure script and makefiles. -O2 compiler flag can now
    be replaced with $CFLAGS environment variable. Earlier $CFLAGS were
    just appended after -O2. $LDFLAGS and $CC are the other recognizable
    environment variables for configure. The makefiles do not recognize
    environment variables. All compile options must be given for the
    configure script.

    Fixed MinGW platform detection and src/Makefile.in. Link flags in
    the compile rule must be after object files. Thanks to Genju and Poohbear.

    "xdms foo.dms" is now short-hand for "xdms u foo.dms". The "u" command
    is an unnecessary paramter for most use cases so it is not needed
    anymore. Updated the man page accordingly.

No version : 2007-01-10
    Fixed C datatypes for building xdms on DJGPP. Thanks to Andreas.

2007-11-04: USE OF CHANGELOG FILE IS NOW DEPRECATED. SEE THE VERSION CONTROL
	    LOG. USE "git log".
